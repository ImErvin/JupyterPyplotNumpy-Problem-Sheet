    "### Fisher's Iris Dataset\n",
    "Fisher's Iris Dataset is a multivariate (analysis of more than out outcome variable. [2]) dataset of the Iris flower. The dataset was introduced by a British statistician Ronald Fisher in his paper *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems (1936)* as an example of linear discriminant analysis (method to characterize or separate two or more classes of objects or events for statistics, pattern matching and machine learning to find a linear combination of features. [3]). [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the dataset?\n",
    "The dataset consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (setosa, versicolor and virginica with four features that were measured for each sample: length and width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the dataset used for?\n",
    "The dataset was used to develop a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other. [1]\n"
